# Simulation Hub

A growing collection of interactive simulations for exploring physical,
biological, and mathematical systems through visualization and
experimentation.

This repository serves as a centralized hub where individual simulations
can be developed, tested, and accessed from a single interface.

## 🎯 Project Mission

The goal of this project is to make abstract or complex systems more
intuitive by allowing direct manipulation of parameters and real-time
observation of system behavior.

Rather than polished production apps, these simulations prioritize:
- clarity
- interactivity
- experimentation
- rapid iteration
